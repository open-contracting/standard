# Tools

There are a growing number of tools available to support implementation of OCDS.

Tools developed by the core team will be available at [https://github.com/open-contracting/](https://github.com/open-contracting/).

## Core tools

### OCDS Validator

The OCDS validator can be found at [http://standard.open-contracting.org/validator/](http://standard.open-contracting.org/validator/) and can be used to:

* Check releases and records against the JSON OCDS schema;
* Provide basic statistics on the data contained within OCDS files;
* Convert between flat and structured JSON formats.

### OCDS Merge

This python library provides functions to merge a list of OCDS Releases into either a compiledRelease or a versionedRelease needed to create an OCDS record.

```ocdsmerge``` is available as a python package, [or on GitHub](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-merge) along with usage instructions.

## Community tools

We will be developing a list of community developed tools which consume or produce OCDS data here.

In the meantime, please share suggestions for tools with the mailing list.

## Archived tools

A number of older tools, created during the development of the standard, can be found in the [Open Contracting Archive GitHub organization](https://github.com/open-contracting-archive).
