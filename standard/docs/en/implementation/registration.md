# Registration

<span class="lead">The identifiers section describes the composition of a globally unique open contracting identifier. On this page you can request an ocid prefix, and can submit details of your published data, as well as checking existing prefixes</span>

## OCID Prefix

We are in the process of establishing a self-service registration system for OCID prefixes. In the meantime, to request an OCID prefix please e-mail <a href="mailto:data@open-contracting.org">data@open-contracting.org</a> with the name of your organization.

### Existing prefixes

This list below shows currently registered prefixes.

## Register your data

OCDS does not have a registry of datasets. The approach for data discovery is described in the [publication patterns](../../../implementation/hosting/) section of this documentation.

However, during this initial phase of OCDS we encourage publishers to share details of their data on the [mailing list](../../../support), and we will explore opportunities to work with the community on maintaining tools to support discovery of data.
