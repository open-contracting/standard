# Develop your own extension

The core OCDS schema provides a set of sections, building blocks and fields for describing a wide range of different contracting processes. 

Data publishers or users may have additional data that they could publish, or that they need. Instead of ignoring this data and leaving it unpublished, OCDS encourages publishers and users to collaborate on the creation of extensions to the standard.

This can result in two kinds of extension:

* **Core** extensions are documented as part of the standard and reviewed by the OCDS technical team with each version upgrade of OCDS. They are likely to be relevant to a large number of publishers and users.

* **Community** extension are maintained by third-parties, or are maintained outside of the standard governance process. They may provide features required by only a small number of publishers or users.

Both kinds of extension provide documentation and schema that can be used to produce and validate extended OCDS data. 

Core extensions are embedded directly within the OCDS reference documentation, and versioned along with the standard.

Links to externally hosted local extensions may be included in the OCDS reference documentation, drawing on the [extensions registry](https://github.com/open-contracting/extension_registry). 

## Extension template

You can find the [extension template](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard_extension_template) on GitHub. It contains guidance on creating an extension.
