# Extensions

OCDS provides a common core of [sections and building blocks](../../../getting_started/building_blocks.md) for describing contracting processes. 

Many publishers will have additional data that they could publish. Instead of ignoring this data and leaving it unpublished, OCDS encourages publishers to collaborate on the creation of **extensions** to the standard. 

Extensions are divided into two types:

* **Core** extensions are documented as part of the standard and reviewed by the OCDS technical team with each version upgrade of OCDS. They are likely to be relevant to a large number of publishers and users.

* **Community** extension are maintained by third-parties, or are maintained outside of the standard governance process. They may provide features required by only a small number of publishers or users.

Some extensions with wide adoption may be considered for inclusion as part of the core standard in future versions. Others may be maintained independently by particular communities that need to align the publication of particular additional information.
