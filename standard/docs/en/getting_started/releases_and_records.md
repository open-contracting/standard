# Releases and Records

There are two kinds of OCDS document:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width="50%" align="center"><img src="../../../assets/green_release.svg.png" width="50%"></td>
        <td width="50%" align="center"><img src="../../../assets/green_compilation.svg.png" width="50%"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
<td valign="top" style="padding:10px;" markdown=1>

**Releases** provide updates on each event in a contracting process, ideally in real-time. They can be used to notify users of new tenders, awards, contracts and other updates. One contracting process may have many releases.

**Records** compile together all the information known about a contracting process, providing a snapshot view of its current state. They can also contain a versioned history of changes over time. There should only be one record for each contracting process, created by merging together the releases.

    </tr>
</table>

## Releases

Releases should be immutable: presenting information about a particular event in the lifetime of a contracting process.

Each release must contain an ```ocid```, a unique release ```id```, a release ```tag```, and as much information as can be provided for users to understand the event taking place.

For example:

* A 'planning' release may provide information in the ```planning``` section about budgets and procurement intention, and the ```tender``` section about the proposed details for a future tender;
* A 'tender' release may provide information in the ```tender``` section about how to bid for the work, and may repeat ```planning``` section information on the budget or project the tender is associated with;
* A 'tenderUpdate' release may provide an updated ```tender``` section with links to documents that answer questions asked during the enquiry period;
* An 'award' release may provide details of the supplier awarded the contract in the ```award``` section, and may provide repeated information about the how procurement took place in the ```tender``` section;
* A 'contract' release may provide the details of the signed contract in a ```contract``` section, matched with a related ```award``` section;
* An 'implementationUpdate' release may repeat details of the ```contract```, and provide information on milestones achieved and payments to the supplier, or may update the contract ```implementation``` section with links to newly published documents.

You can think of **releases** as entries into a ledger: each new entry adds information. Each entry may also repeat the previous information that remains true.

### Examples

```eval_rst

.. jsoninclude:: docs/en/examples/planning.json
   :jsonpointer: /releases
   :expand: releases, planning, tag, documents

```

```eval_rst

.. jsoninclude:: docs/en/examples/tender.json
   :jsonpointer: /releases
   :expand: releases, tender, items, tag, documents

```

```eval_rst

.. jsoninclude:: docs/en/examples/tenderUpdate.json
   :jsonpointer: /releases
   :expand: releases, tender, tag, documents

```

```eval_rst

.. jsoninclude:: docs/en/examples/award.json
   :jsonpointer: /releases
   :expand: releases, awards, value, suppliers, items, contractPeriod, tag, documents

```

```eval_rst

.. jsoninclude:: docs/en/examples/contract.json
   :jsonpointer: /releases
   :expand: releases, contracts, period, value, items, tag, documents

```

```eval_rst

.. jsoninclude:: docs/en/examples/implementation.json
   :jsonpointer: /releases
   :expand: releases, contracts, implementation, transactions, tag, documents

```

### Best practices

In some cases, releases will all come from the same backend system. In others, they will be generated by different systems. By ensuring all releases about a contracting process share an ```ocid```, they can be tied together into a record.

In a complete OCDS implementation, each release would be published at its own persistent URL, and kept online permanently.

In these cases, where publishers are providing a single URI for fetching information on a given contracting process, the ```releaseID``` and ```releaseDate``` must be modified whenever updated data is published. A suggested pattern is to append an incrementing number to the end of the ```ocid``` in order to generate a unique ```releaseID``` for every change. For example:

* ocds-a2ef3d01-1594121/1
* ocds-a2ef3d01-1594121/2
* ocds-a2ef3d01-1594121/3

## Records

An OCDS **record** provides a snapshot of the contracting process at a given point in time, bringing together all the information from the releases to date into one place. It is updated as new information becomes available.

At a minimum, a record should exist for each contracting process to provide a list of all the releases that relate to that contracting process.

However, to allow users to get a snapshot view the contracting process without individually looking up each release , a record should also contain:

* a compiledRelease block, which follows the release schema, and is updated with the most up-to-date value for each field; and, optionally,
* a versionedRelease, which contains a history of all the changes for each field.

The [OCDS merge strategies](../schema/merging.md) set out how to combine multiple releases to create a single record for each contracting process.

```eval_rst

.. jsoninclude:: docs/en/examples/record.json
   :jsonpointer:
   :expand: compiledRelease, tender, award, contracts, implementation, transactions, tag, documents

```
