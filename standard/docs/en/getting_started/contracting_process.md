# The Contracting Process

There are several stages to a contracting process.

OCDS covers:

Not all contracting processes have all stages. For example, direct contracting may start with the award of a contract. However, there will still be information that can be disclosed about the budgets, specifications and selection process even in this case.

You should aim to publish OCDS data close to real-time: releasing data as each stage of a contracting process takes place.

This may involve generating output from a range of different systems. Data published from different systems can be tied together by use of a common Open Contracting ID (```ocid```).

## Defining a contracting process

For public procurement OCDS defines a unique contracting process as:

> All the planning, tendering information, awards, contracts and contract implementation information related to a single initiation process.

An initiation process may be a tender, a direct contract award, or a call to award a concession.

## The Open Contracting ID (ocid)

Each unique contracting process should be assigned an ```ocid```. This is an identifier which can be used to join up data between different stages (as often the data may be stored in different systems).

To make sure the ```ocid```s assigned by two different publishers do not clash, publishers are encouraged to register a publisher prefix. This can be prepended onto locally generated identifiers, giving a globally unique identifier, and allowing disparate data sources to confidently refer to a unique contracting process.

You can [register your ocid prefix here](../implementation/registration.md).

<p class="first admonition-title">Worked Example</p>

In [Mexico City](http://www.contratosabiertos.cdmx.gob.mx/), an initial mapping identified that identifiers were assigned to each tender process or direct award, using a pattern based on the initials or name of the department involved, a tender or contract number, and the year.

For example:

> OM-DGRMSG-004-13

These identifiers uniquely identify each contracting process. Fields and business processes to capture these identifiers at each contracting process stage were added to the relevant systems.

Mexico City then registered a prefix with the OCDS helpdesk. They have been given the prefix 'ocds-87sd3t' which can be added to their unique process identifiers to give a globally unique ocid.

For example:

> ocds-87sd3t-OM-DGRMSG-004-13

All the award notices, contracts and transactions resulting from the tender with this identifier should also share this ocid - allowing Mexico City to bring together a complete picture of each contracting process.

<div class="warning" markdown=1>

<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>

The ```ocid``` is case sensitive. Case should be used consistently whenever an ```ocid``` is presented.

## Mapping your systems

The Open Contracting Data Standard helpdesk provide [a technical assessment template](http://www.open-contracting.org/resources/ocds-technical-assessment-template/) that can be used to identify the different systems involved in managing data on each stage of the contracting process.
