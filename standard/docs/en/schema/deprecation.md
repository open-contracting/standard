# Deprecation

From time to time fields and codelist values may be removed from the Open Contracting Data Standard.

This will be either due to limited use, or because they have been replaced by alternative fields or codelists.

Before a field or codelist value is removed, it will be first marked as deprecated in a major or minor release (e.g. in 1.1), and removal will only take place, subject to the [governance](governance.md) process, in the next major version (e.g. 2.0).
