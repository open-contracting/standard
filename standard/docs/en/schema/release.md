# Release Schema

The release schema provides the authoritative definition of fields and their structure. You can view an interactive version of the release schema below (requires javascript) or [download this version of the schema here](../../../release-schema.json).

The release schema is used to validate the contents of the ```releases``` array of [release packages](release_package.md), and the ```compiledReleases``` array of releases in a [record package](record_package.md).
