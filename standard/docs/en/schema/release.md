# Release Schema

The release schema provides the authoritative definition of fields and their structure. You can view an interactive version of the release schema below (requires JavaScript) or [download this version of the schema here](../../../../release-schema.json).

For this version of OCDS, the canonical URL of the release schema is: <https://standard.open-contracting.org/schema/1__1__4/release-schema.json>

Using the canonical URL guarantees that your software, documentation or other resources will always refer to the specific version of the schema with which they were authored and tested.

The release schema is used to validate the contents of the `releases` array of [release packages](release_package.md), and the `compiledReleases` array of releases in a [record package](record_package.md).
