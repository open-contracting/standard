## Release Package Schema

The release package schema describes the structure of the container for publishing releases. The package contains important metadata.

You can view an interactive version of the release schema below (requires JavaScript) or [download this version of the schema here](../../../../release-package-schema.json).

For this version of OCDS, the canonical URL of the release package schema is: <http://standard.open-contracting.org/schema/1__1__4/release-package-schema.json>

Using the canonical URL guarantees that your software, documentation or other resources will always refer to the specific version of the schema with which they were authored and tested.

Click on schema elements to expand the tree, or use the '+' icon to expand all elements. Use { } to view the underlying schema for any section.
