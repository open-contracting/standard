# Schema Reference

The Open Contracting Data Standard is maintained using JSON Schema.

The main sections and common objects used in the schema are [introduced in the getting started section](../getting_started/building_blocks.md).

In this section you will find the [full JSON schema](release.md) along with the [release package](release_package.md) and [record package](record_package.md) schemas which act as envelopes when publishing using OCDS.

The [release schema reference](reference.md) page provides guidance on using each of the sections and building blocks in the schema, and the [record schema reference](records_reference.md) provides additional information on publishing compiled and versioned records.
