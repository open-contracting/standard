# Record Package Schema

The record package schema describes the container structure for publishing records. The contents of a record are based on the release schema. The package contains important metadata.

You can view an interactive version of the record schema below (requires JavaScript) or [download this version of the schema here](../../../../record-package-schema.json).

A separate, auto-generated, [versioned release validation schema](../../../../versioned-release-validation-schema.json) is provided for validating releases within fully versioned records.

Click on schema elements to expand the tree, or use the '+' icon to expand all elements. Use { } to view the underlying schema for any section.
