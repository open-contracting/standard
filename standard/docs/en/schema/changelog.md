## [1.1.1] - 2017-07-31

### Bug fixes

* [#482](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/482) **[Allow parties.role to be set to null](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/pull/502/commits/475abf598063aae5c22e07baba015d960fcc3a95)** - required by the [merging approach](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1.1-dev/en/schema/merging/).
* [#422](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/422) **[Including currency codelist in documentation and schema](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1.1-dev/en/schema/codelists/#currency)** to support validation of currency values.
* [#479](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/479) **[Fixing incorrect requirement to include releases in record-package-schema.json](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1.1-dev/en/schema/record_package/)**
* [#475](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/475) **Adding enum arrays to all fields in the schema with a closed codelist** to support validation.

### Minor revisions

* [#471](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/471) **[Updating milestoneType codelist](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1.1-dev/en/schema/codelists/#milestone-type)** replacing 'planning' with 'preProcurement' and 'adjudication' with 'assessment' and introducing codes for 'approval' and 'financing'. This is an open codelist, so previous codes remain valid, but publishers able to update to the new codes should do so.
* [#473](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/473) **[Updating definition of contractSchedule in documentType codelist](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1.1-dev/en/schema/codelists/#document-type)**

### Documentation improvements

* **Fixing typographic errors throughout the documentation and codelist descriptions**
* [#480](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/pull/480/commits/c3c41225639a06b0b0552016b32e2fe2e901a8fe) **[Updating basic, intermediate, advanced](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1.1-dev/en/implementation/levels/) publication guidance** - to ensure tables and text are aligned.
* [#489](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/489) **Listing the milestone documents extension as a core extension** - and removing it from the community extensions list. This extension is only needed by publishers with legacy data containing documents at the milestone level.
* [#493](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/493) **[Updating the description of the Organization Identifier Scheme codelist](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1.1-dev/en/schema/codelists/#organization-identifier-scheme)** to reflect that the codelist is now maintained by [org-id.guide](http://www.org-id.guide/).

### Code and build process

* [#506](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/506) **Removed make_field_definitions.py** from utility scripts as it is no longer required.
* **Addition of docstrings to key scripts**

## [1.1.0] - 2017-05-01

### Policy changes

* [#401](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/401) **[Deprecation policy](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/schema/conformance_and_extensions/)** - The deprecation policy has been updated to support deprecation in decimal upgrades.

### Changed

#### Structural updates

* [#368](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/368) **[Updates to organization handling in OCDS](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/schema/reference/#parties)** - We have updated the approach to include organization information in the standard from having embedded blocks of organization information, to using embedded cross-references to a top-level 'parties' array where full organization details are stored. This change reduces duplication of organization information, and enables more flexible disclosure of information on all the parties to a contracting process, including multiple buyers.
* [#357](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/357) **[Amendment handling](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/implementation/amendments/)** - We have replace amendment with an array of amendments, and have updated schema and guidance to remove the option of providing semi-structured changes in an amendment object. Changes between amendments should now be provided using multiple releases, with the option to explicitly declare how releases relate to an amendment included in the new amendments array.

#### Schema validation updates

* [#329](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/329) **[Float for Item.quantity](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/schema/reference/#item)** - Item quantities has been updated to 'number' to support decimal values (e.g 10.5 rather than just 10)
* [#253](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/253) **[Negative amounts](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/schema/reference/#budget)** - We have added support for negative amounts in transactions
* [#323](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/323) **[Standard should specify use of UTF-8 for encoding JSON](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/implementation/serialization/#json)** - We now recommend use of I-JSON and UTF-8 for JSON publication
* [#166](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/166) **[Indicate encoding for CSV serializations](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/implementation/serialization/#multi-table)** - We have added information on CSV encoding to the implementation guidance to recommend UTF-8 or windows-1252.
* [#336](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/336) **[Codelist properties in schema](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/commit/ee1db256d7364ee70e3553f4384d9908bff604a6)** - We have included explicit references to the codelist files (CSV versions) in the schema. This will be used in future versions of the validator to support validation against codelists.
* [#301](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/301) **[Specifying versions and extensions in package metadata](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/schema/records_reference/#package-metadata)** - We have updated the package schemas to require that version is declared, and to provide a means of declaring extensions in use. This will be used in future versions of the validator to support validation against extensions.
* [#287](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/287) **[Remove all ocdsMerge strategies](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/schema/merging/)** - We have remove all 'merge strategies' from the schema as these are no longer required, now that all objects in arrays contain an id element.

#### Schema definition updates

* [#372](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/372) **[Updates to transactions terminology](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/schema/reference/#transaction)** - We have replaced receiverOrganization and providerOrganization with payee and payer, to align with more familiar terminology, and have replaced 'amount' with 'value' for consistency with other areas of the standard.
* [#378](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/378) **[Updates to core budget block](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/schema/reference/#budget)** - We have updated references to the Fiscal Data Package in the schema.
* [#337](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/337) **[Definition of "tenderer" to enhance clarity](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/schema/reference/#tender)** - We have updated the definition of tenderer in the tenders block, and cross-referenced the bid extension.
* [#259](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/259) **[Enquiries](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/extensions/enquiries/)** - We have updated the definition of hasEnquiries.

### Extensions

* [#335](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/335) **[Core and community extensions](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/extensions/developing/)** - We have introduced widespread use of extensions throughout the standard. An extension provides fields and data structures that are optional, either because   (a) they are only relevant in particular contexts or contracting processes; or   (b) they represent a 'stretch goal' for most data publishers, and so are not currently suitable for inclusion in the main standard.   We divide these extensions into 'core extensions' which have wide enough relevance, and technical maturity to be included in the main standard documentation (and which are versioned along with the standard documentation), and 'community extensions' which may have less technical maturity, or which might be versioned independently of the main standard.
* [#259](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/259) **[Enquiries](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/extensions/enquiries/)** - We have introduced a core enquiries extension for providing information on enquiries received during the tender stage.
* [#342](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/342) **[Overall contracting process description](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/schema/reference/#release)** - We have introduced a new top-level title and description for the contracting process as a core extension.
* [#274](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/274) **[New property of contract: extendsContractID](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/schema/reference/#contract)** - We have introduced a new field 'extendsContractID' to the Contract block to support contract cross-referencing between contracts.
* [#381](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/381) **[Lots](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/extensions/lots/)** - We have introduced a core extension to provide a model for contracting processes which are divided into lots.
* [#379](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/379) **[Bids and Bid Statistics](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/extensions/bids/)** - We have introduced a core extension which provides a top level Bids section, with BidStatistics and Bid building blocks for detailed information on individual bids. This supersedes the current tender/tenderers section.
* [#250](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/250) **[Location extension](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/extensions/location/)** - We have moved the location extensions to become a core extension
* [#33](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/33) **[Participation fees (bid document and submission costs)](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/extensions/participation_fee/)** - We have introduced a core extension for declaring the participation fees related to a contracting process.
* [#249](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/249) **[Extend contract with a supplier array](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/extensions/contract_suppliers/)** - We have introduced a core extension to allow inclusion of supplier information at the contract level.

### Deprecated

* [#355](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/355) **[Deprecating milestone documents](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/schema/reference/#milestone)** - We have deprecated milestone documents from core, and added a milestone documents extension for those who wish to continue to use documents at the milestone level.
* [#368](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/368) **[Updates to organization handling in OCDS](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/schema/reference/#parties)** - We have deprecated use of the full organization block at points other than the parties array.
* [#372](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/372) **[Updates to transactions terminology](http://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/schema/reference/#transaction)** - receiverOrganization, providerOrganization and amount properties have been deprecated in favour or other terms.
