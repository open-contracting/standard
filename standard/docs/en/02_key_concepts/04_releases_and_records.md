# Documents, Releases & Records

## Documents

<span class="lead">Documents are a vital part of the Open Contracting Data Standard. Whilst releases and records provide a machine-readable summary of a contracting process, they should always be supported by links to well-managed documents.</span>

A contracting process generates many documents - from procurement plans, to tender notices and calls for proposals, and the actual text of contracts. Wherever there is no legal or policy restriction on doing so, these should be placed online in a stable location, and linked to from within the relevant OCDS release and records. 

See the [attachments](../../schema/reference#attachment) section of [schema reference](../../schema/reference) for more details of how to include documents in your data releases, and the [documentType code list](../../schema/codelists#document-type) for a list of common documents that may be included.

ToDo: NOTE THAT DOCUMENTS CAN BE ATTACHED IN A RANGE OF PLACES.

## Releases

To encourage the greatest possible openness of public contracting information, the Open Contracting Data Standard is designed to support **real-time publication of information**. At each stage of the contracting process, or at each point when changes, or amendments, are made to data about the contracting process, the standard allows publishers to provide a **release**.

Releases are cumulative. Over a contracting process releases may be provided to describe a tender, announce contract awards, detail a finalised contract, and provide updates on implementation. Once published, a release must not be changed. Updated information should be shared through a new release.

Releases may originate from a single system, or may be published in a distributed way by different systems, but releases relating to the same contracting process are tied together by use of the same Open Contracting ID (OCID).

You can think of releases as entries into a ledger: each new entry adds information, and may repeat previous information that remains true. The **record** brings together a snapshot of the latest state of all the information.

<div class="well">
<p>In a complete OCDS implementation, each release would be published at its own URL, and kept online permanently. This may be difficult for some publishers to implement over the short term.
</p>
<p>
In these cases, where publishers are providing a single URI for fetching information on a given contracting process, the releaseID and releaseDate must be modified whenever updated data is published.   A suggested pattern is to append an incrementing number to the end of the OCID in order to generate a unique releaseID for every change. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>ocds-a2ef3d01-1594121/1</li>
    <li>ocds-a2ef3d01-1594121/2</li>
    <li>ocds-a2ef3d01-1594121/3</li>
</ul>
</div>

**ToDo: [UPDATE] **The publication guidance includes suggested approaches to expose feeds of releases for users. Users seeking to compete for public contracts, for example, may wish to follow a feed of releases relating to a particular kind of good or service. Anti-corruption users may wish to follow all new releases, in order to compile their own independent record of changes throughout a contracting process.

## Records

A contracting **record** provides a snapshot of all the key elements of a contracting process. It is updated as new information becomes available through releases and should provide **an at-a-glance view that accurately reflects the current state of the contract processes**. Contracting records can also contain a version history of key fields, showing how the contract has changed over time. 

Contracting records may be published in full, or may contain a pointer to web-accessible releases in order to allow third-parties to assemble and verify a record of the whole contracting process.

The OCDS Schema defines a set of merge strategies to explain when to overwrite past data in the main body of the record, and when to append data.

(**ToDo:** Pull out merge strategies in some meaningful way to display in the documentation)

<div class="well">
<p>
<strong>Worked example</strong>
</p>
<p>
A publisher provides a tender release on 1st January, with a planned contract value of $1000.
</p>
<p>
On 31st January, the publisher provides an amended tender release updating the planned contract value to $1500.
</p>
<p>
After assessing bids, it is decided to award the contract in two lots.
</p>
<p>
On 1st March, the publisher provides an award release, announcing Company A have been awarded a contract for $750.
</p>
<p>
On 3rd March, the publisher provides an separate award release, announcing that company B have been awarded a contract for $750
</p>
<p>
These independent releases each provide real-time information about what is happening in the contracting process. The record will combine them together. Using the same schema and structure as the releases, the main body of the record will contain a tender with contract value of $1500, and details of both awards.
</p>
<p>
If the record is complete with versioning information, then the versioning section will reveal that the planned contract value changed from $1000 to $1500 on 31st January.
</p>
</div>

Publishers may not all be able to initially provide fully versioned releases, but should publish in such a way that third parties can create these fully versioned releases if they choose.

## Updates and amendments

When new information becomes available, it should be contained in a new release, and the contracting record should be updated to reflect this. 

The term amendment has a specific legal significance in many jurisdictions. The ```releaseTag``` provides a way to indicate when a release is an amendment, and the schema includes space to provide details of changes, and justification for the amendment that is being made.

When **records** are created by merging together **releases** then a version history that can be used to track changes to fields is created in the **record**, allowing users to look back and see the changes that have occured over the lifetime of a contracting process. 

<div class="well">
Some publishers may wish to make past data available without generating releases for each change that happened to the contract. Whilst the recommended approach is to generate releases, and compile these into a record, it is possible to follow the <strong>record schema</strong>, the guidance on merging, and the pattern for representing versioned information within of records, to generate a record directly from a database.

ToDo: Review Amendment Information

## Notices

Good open contracting practice involves the widespread publication of key **notices** about different stages of the contracting process. Publishers should include details in their OCDS files of where tender, awards and contract notices were made available, both online and offline.

Users want to be able to know when notices were published, where they were published, and what they contained. 

A notice can be attached to a tender, award or contract within OCDS using the ```documents``` property, and a ```documentType``` value of ‘notice’. If the notice is accessible online, then the URL to the notice can be given. If the notice was published in a printed publication, or posted in some other public venue, the document ```description``` field can be used to explain this, and the ```format``` can be set to ‘offline/print’. The ```publicationDate``` of the document should be the date the notice was made available.

## Packages

<span class="lead">For the convenience of users, a collection of releases, or a collection of records, can be combined together in a release or record package.</span>
