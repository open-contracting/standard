"A license statement sets out the permission that users have to access, "

"Dedication or Certification which transfers a dataset into the public "
"domain, or re-asserts that there are no existing copyrights or database "
"rights inherent in the dataset (which is the case for government datasets"
" in some jurisdictions), or the application of a license which sets out "
"the terms under which a dataset may be re-used."

"Public domain dedication – asserting no copyright, database rights, or "
"contractual rights over the open contracting data. Examples include "
"Creative Commons’ public domain tools. These licenses are useful for "
"publishers who manage their own works or have the necessary rights to "
"apply a public domain license to another person’s work. In addition, "
"although attribution cannot be \"enforced\" under such licenses, we "
"recommend that you actively acknowledge and give attribution to all "
"sources, such as the data providers or any data aggregators. Public "
"domain approaches are preferred for Open Contracting Datasets."

"Particular attention should be paid to ensuring license information on "
