"**Releases** provide updates on each event in a contracting process, ideally"
" in real-time. They can be used to notify users of new tenders, awards, "
"contracts and other updates. One contracting process may have many releases."

"**Records** compile together all the information known about a contracting "
"process, providing a snapshot view of it's current state. They can also "
"contain a versioned history of changes over time. There should only be one "
"record for each contracting process, created by merging together the "
"releases."

"In these cases, where publishers are providing a single URI for fetching "
