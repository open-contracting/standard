"The lots extension maintains the overall structure of an OCDS release, with "
"items, documents and milestones nested immediately within ```tender```, "
"```award``` and ```contract``` items, but it introduces an array of Lots in "
"the ```tender``` section, and the ability to cross-reference a specific "

"documents, milestones and awards."

"This means that systems which are not 'lot aware' can still understand the "

"the information to users, or to analyse contracting lot by lot."
