"**Validation** involves a technical check on the way data is structured and "
"formatted. If data is not valid JSON, and does not comply with the OCDS "
"schema, then it cannot be processed by OCDS tools, and will not be "
"interoperable with other data. Providing valid data is an important "
"foundation for interoperable open data."

msgid ""
"**Conformance** involves a detailed check on whether OCDS terms are being "
"used correctly. For example, are you following the field definitions and "
"guidance when entering data, and mapping to the OCDS structure. Conformance "
"involves a human check on how fields are being used, and which extensions to"
" the schema you are using."

"The OCDS validator provides feedback that can be used to make an initial "

"**Completeness** involves checking which sections and building blocks of "
"OCDS are being used. For example, are you publishing information from every "
"contracting stage, or are you only providing tender or award data; and are "
"you providing detailed identifiers for organisations, or just names."

"Completeness can be evaluated against the Basic, Intermediate, Advanced "
"framework for OCDS."

"**Utility** involves checking whether the data is fit for purpose. This "
"involves considering the priority use cases for the data, and considering "
"whether all feasible steps that could increase the re-usablility of the data"
" have been taken. Quality involves considering questions of coherence (do "
"the relationships in the data make sense, and is information logically "
"structured?) and usefulness."

"The best way to test the utility of the data is through its successful use "
"for analysis, monitoring and increasing access to contracting information."
