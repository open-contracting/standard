# Assets

The .svg assets were made in Inkscape (a free & open source vector graphics
software available for Windows, Mac, and Linux [www.inkscape.org](http://www.inkscape.org).

They are then exported from there to the .png assets that are used in the
standard to improve compatibility across browsers.
