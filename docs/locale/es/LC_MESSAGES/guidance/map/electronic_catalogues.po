"Electronic catalogs can often be found in more complicated procedures, "
"usually together with framework agreements and involving multiple bidders. "
"However, on their own, they are simply an electronic format (typically "
"prescribed by the buyer) that participants in the contracting process must "
"follow when exchanging information about technical specifications, "
"evaluation criteria, bids, lots, etc. As such, catalogs do not influence the"
" structure of the data (e.g. the relationships between awards, contracts, "
"buyers and suppliers) in any special way."
