"The [merging documentation](../../schema/merging) specifies how individual "
"releases are merged into compiled releases (the latest version of the "
"contracting process) and versioned releases (the change history for each "
"field), which form part of a "
"[record](../../getting_started/releases_and_records)."

"The merge routine also allows a publisher to correct a publication error by "
"deleting a field, object or array entry from the compiled release. To do so,"
" a publisher sets the field's value to `null` in an individual release (more"
" on this below). As such, as a publisher, it is important to **never use a "
"`null` value in an individual release, unless you intend to delete that "
"field**. If you don't have a value to assign to a field, simply omit the "
"field from the JSON, or assign an empty value like `\"\"`, `[]` or `{}`. "
"Using `null` values correctly means that publishers and/or users can create "
"compiled releases reliably."
