"The OCDS brings together the data published at each stage using a single "
"open contracting process identifier: the **OCID.** An OCID is composed of a "
"prefix, [registered by the publisher with OCP](../guidance/build.md"
"#register-an-ocid-prefix), and a unique process identifier chosen by the "
"publisher."

"In designing the OCDS, we [explored](https://www.open-"
"contracting.org/resources/demand-side-assessment-report/) a range of "
"different user needs and use cases for data about public contracting. Each "
"use case has different data needs in terms of data fields, documents, "
"publication frequency, and data quality. The OCDS provides a common "
"framework to maximize the number of user needs that can be met through data "
"and document disclosure."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/primer/how.md:93
msgid ""
"In addition to the OCID, another component of OCDS' common framework is the "
"OCDS **schema.** The schema sets out the fields, structure, data types and "
"validation rules for OCDS data. The schema is described using JSON Schema, "
"and the default format of the data is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). The"
" schema is documented in the [Reference](../schema/index) section of the "
"OCDS."

"While the OCDS schema is described using JSON Schema, OCDS data can be "

"many relationships (such as multiple bids per tender notice)."
