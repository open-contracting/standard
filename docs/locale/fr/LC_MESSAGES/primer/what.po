"The Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) is a free, non-proprietary open "

"There are three concepts behind the OCDS: **Open Contracting, Open Data,** "
"and **Data Standard**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/primer/what.md:18
msgid ""
"**Open contracting** is about publishing and using open, accessible and "
"timely information on public contracting to engage citizens and businesses "
"to fix problems and deliver results. These results include improving the "
"efficiency, effectiveness and integrity of a public contracting system."

"**Open data** is data that can be freely used, modified, and shared by "
"anyone for any purpose. This requires data to be accessible and machine-"
"readable, and for permission to be granted for reuse."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/primer/what.md:20

"**Data standards** define the structure and meaning of data in order to "
"resolve ambiguity and help systems and people interpret it."

"The OCDS builds on all three of these concepts, and the ultimate goal of the"
" OCDS is to **help deliver** open contracting using standardized open data. "
"The OCDS describes how to publish data and documents for the procurement of "
"goods, works, and services. It makes contracting data available for anyone "
"to use, modify, and share, for any purpose."

"The OCDS can be adapted to meet your needs. Whether purchasing medicines, "
"running a municipal recycling program or building an airport, the OCDS helps"
" you organize and publish all relevant data and documents during the "
"process."

#: ../../docs/primer/what.md:26
msgid ""
"The OCDS is not an electronic procurement system or database. But it can "
"inform how data is collected, stored and published in these systems. The "
"OCDS can help make sure that the contracting data you collect and publish "
"meet global best practices and are fit-for-purpose to meet the needs of a "
"range of different users."

"The OCDS helps to increase transparency, enables deeper analysis of "
"contracting data, and facilitates the use of data by a wide range of "
"stakeholders. Academic research shows that improved openness and "
"transparency is good for public integrity, value for money and competition "
"when it is linked to systemic changes that allow people to use the "
"information. [More than 50 countries and cities, from Argentina to "
"Zambia](https://www.open-contracting.org/impact/), are pursuing open "
"contracting reforms to make public procurement fairer and more efficient."
