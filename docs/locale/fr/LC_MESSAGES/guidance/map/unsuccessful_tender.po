"In the case of procurement, a contracting process can be defined as a "

"In OCDS, at a conceptual level, a contracting process is intended to match "
"each concrete attempt to start a procedure that leads to one or more "
"contracts. Attempts can include: an invitation to tender (in open "
"procedure); an invitation to request to participate; a competition for a "
"concession; a direct award, etc."

"In OCDS, the `ocid` is the unique identifier for a contracting process. As "

"In most jurisdictions, if a procedure is cancelled or unsuccessful, and a "
"**new procedure** is started to procure the same items, the two procedures "
"are considered two **different** contracting processes. This is in keeping "
"with the OCDS definition of a contracting process."

"But in other jurisdictions, such as Paraguay, the planning stage is "
"considered as the initiation of the process. In these jurisdictions when a "
"tender fails and a new tender is started, the two tenders are considered "
"part of the same contracting process. This differs from the OCDS definition "
"of a contracting process."

"In OCDS, it is relevant and desirable to include the planning information "
"that relates to the process, but the contracting process is not interpreted "
"as ‘starting’ with the planning stage. In OCDS, the planning stage is "
"something that comes **before** the initiation of a contracting process. The"
" initiation of the procedure is not the planning stage, because at least one"
" of the following is true of a planning stage: it is not a concrete attempt "
"to award one or more contracts like a request for tender, etc.; it is not a "
"concrete opportunity for potential suppliers to participate in; it does not "
"describe the competitive conditions."
