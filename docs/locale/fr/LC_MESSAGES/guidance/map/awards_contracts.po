"In OCDS, **awards** and **contracts** are modelled as separate stages of the"
" contracting process. This approach allows for the possibility that an award"
" is made but a contract is never entered into. The model also allows for the"
" possibility that there is a difference between the award and the signed "
"contract, either in value, duration, items or otherwise. While such "
"differences might be illegal in some jurisdictions, they can occur in some "
"cases and are therefore possible in OCDS. Source systems can contain data on"
" awards, on contracts, or on both."
