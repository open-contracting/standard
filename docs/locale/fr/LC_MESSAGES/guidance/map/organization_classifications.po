"Many publishers wish to disclose and monitor information about different "
"classifications of organizations involved in contracting processes. Example "
"classifications include organization ownership, incorporation, sector, "
"location, and number of employees. We recognise that publishing information "
"about a variety of organization characteristics, for example women-owned "
"and/or indigenous-owned organizations, is an important part of monitoring "
"participation in public procurement."

"Some organization classifications, such as organization scale, can be "

"For classifications that have become standardized, there are specific OCDS "

"organization scale, which ought to be disclosed using the [party scale "
"extension](https://extensions.open-"
"contracting.org/en/extensions/partyScale/master/). This extension adds a "

"For non-standardized options, such as classifying forms of organization "
"ownership, publishers ought to use the [organization classification "
"extension](https://github.com/open-contracting-"
"extensions/ocds_organizationClassification_extension). This extension adds a"
" [`classifications`](../../schema/reference.md#classification) array to the "
"`parties.details` block to enable the categorization of organizations. Each "
"`classification.id` field ought to contain a code from the particular scheme"
" given in the `classification.scheme` field. Details about the particular "
"organization characteristic that is being disclosed ought to be provided in "
"the `classification.description` field. The given `classification.scheme` "
"can be an existing scheme (drawn from the open [itemClassificationScheme "
"codelist](../../schema/codelists.md#item-classification-scheme)), or a local"

"In the examples below, two different publishers have disclosed information "

" classification needs to consist of at least two parts: an identifier for "
"the list (scheme) from which the classification is taken, and an identifier "
"for the category from that list being applied. It is useful to also publish "
"a text label and/or URI that users can draw on to interpret the "
"classification. In the first example below, the publisher re-uses an "
"existing `classification.scheme`. In the second example below, where a "
"publisher wishes to track specific policy-related data, a local list of "
"categories is used in preference to mapping to a generic set."
