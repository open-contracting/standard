"OCDS encourages the use of the [releases and "
"records](../../primer/releases_and_records) model in order to publish up-to-"
"date, timely data. However, sometimes publishers can't fully support the "
"model, because historic data of contracting processes is not stored in the "
"source system(s). In such case, the publisher can produce only one release "
"for each contracting process, and the release gets overridden with new "
"updates."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/guidance/build/easy_releases.md:5
msgid ""
"In this situation, it is possible to still meet OCDS requirements by "
"following a strategy to build different release identifiers each time the "
"data changes in a contracting process. Over the course of multiple updates, "
"third parties would be able to build their own data store by periodically "
"downloading or scraping the published data, and identifying the updates "
"using release identifiers."

#: ../../docs/guidance/build/easy_releases.md:9
msgid ""
"**When the system saves a last modified date for entities** - use the dates "
"to create a new release ID. This can be as simple as appending the date to "
"the release identifier."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/guidance/build/easy_releases.md:10
msgid ""
"**When the system does not contain a last modified date** - use a hash of "

" previous, existent identifier for the same contracting process."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/guidance/build/easy_releases.md:22
msgid ""
"In an 'Easy' releases scenario it is still necessary to package data. "

"When producing a single release for each contracting process, we can't use "

"'tenderUpdate' which follows the 'tender' tag."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/guidance/build/easy_releases.md:30
msgid ""
"In this case, tags need to indicate the sections of the schema which are "

" and `contract` sections, the `tag` array would look like this:"

"This makes more sense if we realize that a release is always the \"first "
"release\" of a contracting process for an user that access the data for the "
