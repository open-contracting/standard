"Integrity in public procurement is about identifying, preventing and "
"combating corruption, fraud, and other types of illicit behavior. "
"Proactively calculating red flag indicators and applying risk detection "
"methods, using open contracting data, can potentially detect corruption and "
"fraud before it happens and deter illicit behavior. This changes the anti-"
"corruption approach from punitive to preventive. Monitoring anomalous "
"procurement behavior, even when that behavior isn’t actually the result of a"
" corrupt or illicit process, can help governments identify and resolve "
"overarching inefficiencies in public procurement."

"There are two main approaches to fraud and corruption monitoring. A ‘micro’ "
"approach closely scrutinizes individual procurements: for example, flagging "

" to map out networks of funding, ownership and interests: for example, "
"calculating collusion risk in a particular market."

"Monitoring service delivery looks at how public procurement delivers value "
