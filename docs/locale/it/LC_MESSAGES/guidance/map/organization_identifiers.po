"Normally, publishers collect *legal identifiers* from the organizations that"
" are part of the contracting process. [Organization "
"identifiers](../../../schema/identifiers/#organization-ids) can be provided "
"in OCDS by identifying the **organization registers** used in the source "
"data, choosing an appropiate **organization register prefix** for each one, "
"and identifying the organizational ID for each registry or list and "
"organization in the data."

"Use [org-id.guide](http://org-id.guide/) to find the code for the register "

"If a publisher chooses not to register an organization list with org-"

"[publication policy](../../publish/#finalize-your-publication-policy), and "

"The Government of UK uses identifiers from the UK Companies House to "
"uniquely identify suppliers. The UK Companies House has an entry in [org-"
"id.guide](http://org-id.guide/list/GB-COH), which specifies the \"GB-COH\" "
"code for the registry. IBM has been assigned the company number ‘04336774’ "
"by the Companies House.  The globally unique organization identifier for IBM"
" can then be expressed as in the `identifier` section in the sample below:"

"The publisher also collects two extra identifiers, which are disclosed in "
"the `additionalIdentifiers` block. The first one is the VAT identification "
"number for suppliers. Note that the VAT registry is not present in org-"
"id.guide, but the publisher followed the instructions in the [org-id meta-"
"data guide](http://docs.org-id.guide/en/latest/metadata/#assigning-a-code) "
"to build the \"GB-VAT\" code used in the `scheme` field: the two-letter "
"country prefix (\"GB\") plus a short abbreviation for the registry "
"(\"VAT\"). The publisher checked that it does not conflict with any list "
"code in org-id.guide."
