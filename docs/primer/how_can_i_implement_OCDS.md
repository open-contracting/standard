Implementing the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) is driven by the guidance and reference sections of the documentation. This page exists to:

*   Outline next steps you can follow to start implementing OCDS documentation
*   Direct you to resources for getting help on implementing OCDS
```
Beyond the Primer, we have developed detailed documentation to guide you in implementing the Open Contracting Data Standard. The remainder of the documentation covers:

*   [Guidance](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/guidance/): Step-by-step instructions on how to design and implement an OCDS publication, including helpful tools and examples
*   [Reference](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/schema/): Describing the specific rules that need to be followed to publish OCDS data
*   [Getting help](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/support/): Outlining how you can get Helpdesk support and how you can participate in the OCDS community
*   [History](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/history/): Information about the changes in each version of the OCDS
*   [Governance](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/governance/): Details about the stewardships, development, and revisions process for OCDS
*   [Data Review Tool](https://standard.open-contracting.org/review/): A tool to help check whether your data is following the OCDS correctly.

OCDS also offers a free helpdesk service to support you in publishing or using OCDS data. If you are planning to publish or use OCDS data, then the OCDS Helpdesk is on-hand to offer advice and input, by:

*   Helping you identify approaches for converting data from your existing systems to OCDS
*   Suggesting existing tools and services that can help you publish or use OCDS data
*   Providing guidance on mapping your data structures to OCDS
*   Giving you feedback on draft data files, and checking the structure of your data

Helpdesk support is available in English and Spanish and delivered through collaboration with the Open Data Services Cooperative in the United Kingdom and Centro de Desarrollo Sostenible in Paraguay. If you have a question about OCDS implementation, e-mail [data@open-contracting.org](mailto:data@open-contracting.org) and a member of the OCDS Helpdesk will be in touch with you soon.
