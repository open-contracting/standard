# Development and Appreciation

## Development

### Version 1.0.0

Version 1.0.0 was developed for the [Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org/) by the [World Wide Web Foundation](https://webfoundation.org/) and the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/), through a project supported by the [Omidyar Network](https://www.omidyar.com) and the World Bank. The 1.0 Release Candidate was developed within a year by:

* **Assessing the data supplied through contracting portals**, in order to understand what data governments published, and how it was structured. We created a [Contracting Data Comparison](http://ocds.open-contracting.org/opendatacomparison/) tool, which includes an analysis of the [distribution](http://ocds.open-contracting.org/opendatacomparison/datamap/) of fields used for common concepts by a wide range of government contracting data portals. [Read the supply-side assessment report](https://www.open-contracting.org/resources/supply-side-assessment-report/).
* **Exploring demand for contracting data**, through field work, interviews and online engagement with different communities and individuals using contracting information. The information needs of users were organized into use cases, which informed the development of, and requirements for, the OCDS. [Read the demand-side assessment report](https://www.open-contracting.org/resources/demand-side-assessment-report/).
* **Iterative, open development**, with reference to the [Principles for Digital Development](https://digitalprinciples.org/). We received broad feedback on the [alpha](https://standard.open-contracting.org/legacy/r/0__2__0/) and [beta](https://standard.open-contracting.org/legacy/r/0__3__2/) releases. All issues were recorded and discussed in a public [issue tracker](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues). We engaged public contracting, open data and other stakeholders through mailing lists, online spaces and development sprints at PyCon Montreal and PyCon Europe 2014. Over 150 people provided comments, feedback and input.

The timeline was:

* **Research** (November 2013 to May 2014): User requirements were collected, and data supply was explored. Technical options for the OCDS were considered and consulted on.
* **Alpha** (June 2014): An [outline data model](https://standard.open-contracting.org/legacy/r/0__2__0/) was shared, and high-level concepts were outlined for consultation. The design of individual fields was started.
* **Beta** (September 2014): A schema, including field definitions, was proposed and opened for consultation. The feedback received motivated many substantial changes.
* **Release candidate** (November 2014): The OCDS was released for final review.
* **Release** (July 2015): Version 1.0.0 was released, with minor bug fixes.

### Upgrade history

* May 31, 2017: Version 1.1: [Summary note on version upgrade](https://www.open-contracting.org/resources/ocds-1-1-summary-note-version-upgrade/), [Governance report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mpLX7R9S_DyPTPZFtoAh0Gt0IHZLDt4WZbM-nzy8xUY/edit)
