# Getting Started

OCDS is an open data standard for publication of structured information on all stages of a contracting process: from planning to implementation.

The publication of OCDS data can enable greater transparency in public contracting, and can support accessible and in-depth analysis of the efficiency, effectiveness, fairness, and integrity of public contracting systems. 

OCDS was designed with a focus on public procurement of goods, works and services, but can be extended for use in other contexts. Extensions for Public Private Partnership (PPP) and Extractives concessions are under development.

To get started publishing OCDS data:

* Discuss the key [users and use cases](use_cases) for your OCDS project
* Identify out the data and documents you will publish from your [contracting process](contracting_process)
* Map your data against the OCDS [building blocks](building_blocks)
* Present the data in [JSON releases and records](releases_and_records)
* Publish your data on the web using the [publication patterns](publication_patterns)
* Check the [validation of your data](validation)
* Encourage and facilitate stakeholder use of the data

When you are done you could be producing data that looks something like the contract release below, which is compatible with a growing range of OCDS aware tools (you will encounter a range of different OCDS release types in the following pages).

```{jsoninclude} ../examples/contract.json
:jsonpointer: /releases
:expand: releases, tender, awards, contracts, period, value, items, tag, parties, documents
