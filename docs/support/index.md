# Getting Help

## OCDS Helpdesk

The Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) Helpdesk is available to support you in publishing or using OCDS data, and to assist in the ongoing development of the standard.

If you are planning to publish or use OCDS data, then the OCDS Helpdesk is on-hand to offer advice and input, by:

* Helping you identify approaches for converting data from your existing systems to OCDS
* Suggesting existing tools and services that can help you publish or use OCDS data
* Providing guidance on mapping your data structures to OCDS
* Giving you feedback on draft data files, and checking the structure of your data

Helpdesk support is available in English and Spanish and delivered through collaboration with the [Open Data Services Cooperative](https://opendataservices.coop) in the United Kingdom and [Centro de Desarrollo Sostenible](http://www.cds.com.py) in Paraguay.

Through funding from the Open Contracting Partnership, this support is provided free of charge.

Please e-mail [data@open-contracting.org](mailto:data@open-contracting.org) with your questions, and a member of the OCDS Helpdesk will be in touch with you soon.

## OCDS Community

The Open Contracting community is a great source of input and support. You can ask questions, discuss ideas, and share news on your projects on the [standard-discuss@open-contracting.org](https://groups.google.com/a/open-contracting.org/g/standard-discuss) mailing list.

You can also contribute directly to public discussions about implementing the standard and give feedback on its development, via the issue tracker of its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard).

## OCDS Tools

There are a growing number of tools available to support the publication and use of OCDS data. Please refer to the [Open Contracting Tools Directory](https://www.open-contracting.org/resources/open-contracting-tools-directory/).
