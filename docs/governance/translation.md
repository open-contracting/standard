# Translation and localization

```{admonition} Summary
This document contains our translation and localization policy.
```

## Key concepts

To make sure the OCDS is accessible around the world, we pay attention to a number of areas:

* **Internationalization (i18n)**: The process of designing a standard, and the tools associated with it, so that it can be localized across different contexts.
* **Translation**: The process of making a standard and its associated tools and documentation available in more than one language.
* **Localization (l10n)**: Going beyond a generic language translation to also consider how a standard and its documentation will be interpreted within a particular local and cultural context.

In general, internationalization is a task during the development of the schema and documentation. Translation for _supported_ languages takes place as part of the [core development process](index). In addition, _community_ translations are accepted. Localization takes place as part of implementation support in particular countries and contexts.

To ensure readers have a clear understanding of the nature of translations, the documentation and schema descriptions will include a clear note explaining the status of any translation.

## Principles

Our approach to supported translations will be:

1. **Deliberate.** We will be clear on the purpose of translation, and whose needs it should meet.
2. **Accurate.** We will engage local reviewers for languages, and work with reviewers with subject matter expertise to ensure the quality of translation.
3. **Consistent.** We will identify and define key terms, and make sure that whenever they occur in the same context they are translated in the same way.
4. **Accessible.** We will design translation practices around user needs and will consider the audience, their language skills and technical qualifications, and their specific needs for translation.
5. **Usable.** We will honor the work we are asking the reader or user of our translations to do by making sure translations are fit for purpose.
6. **Iterative.** We will listen to user feedback and make sure there is a way to capture and act on it.
7. **Transparent.** We will provide access to the translation process and decision making, accounting for the translations decisions we make.

## Policy

### Language support

* The authoritative language for the standard is English. All translations into other languages are provided for the convenience of users, and in case of conflict or ambiguity, the English text supersedes all translations.
* Our core **supported translations** are listed on the standard website. Translations in these languages will be reviewed by subject matter and language experts.

  The standard governance group will approve or remove supported languages, taking note of where there is wide community interest expressed through issues and community discussion spaces, ongoing implementation of OCDS, and resources available for ongoing translation.
* **Supported translations** will be actively maintained by the OCDS technical team, kept up to date when the standard is updated. For supported translations we will have a well-managed glossary of key terms, reviewed by language and subject matter experts.
* We welcome **community translations** in other languages. We do not assess or review the accuracy of community translations.
* **Community translations** are contributed by volunteers. There is no commitment to keep these updated when the standard changes.
* **Community translations** will only be linked from the documentation when the schema is fully translated, and at least 50% of other documentation pages are translated. Community translations may be removed if they appear to be abandoned, misleading, inaccurate or detrimental to the standard, by the OCDS technical team at any time.

### Draft and release process

* **Draft** translations (supported or community) may be made available within the documentation, but only with the addition of a suitable warning notice.
* When a translation is judged by the OCDS technical team to be stable and unlikely to see major changes, it will be flagged as a **release** version, and this clearly indicated.

### Update process

* Whenever a major, minor or patch version of the standard is released, normative content will be translated into all core supported languages as soon as possible.
* Minor, non-normative, documentation updates will be translated promptly, but may not always be translated before the updates are released.
* The documentation will clearly display when the English documentation is 'ahead' of translations for a particular version.
* Community translators will be notified of updates, and encouraged to update their translations.
