# Record Schema

The record schema is used to check the structure of the `records` array of [record packages](packaging/record_package).

For this version of OCDS, the canonical URL of the record schema is: <https://standard.open-contracting.org/schema/1__2__0/record-schema.json>. Using the canonical URL guarantees that your software, documentation or other resources will always refer to the specific version of the schema with which they were authored and tested.

Click on schema elements to expand the tree, or use the '+' icon to expand all elements. Use { } to view the underlying schema for any section. Required fields are indicated in **bold**. [Deprecated fields](../governance/deprecation) are omitted.

:class: note

This page presents the record schema in an interactive browser. You can also download the canonical version of the record schema as [JSON Schema](../../build/current_lang/record-schema.json) or view it as [tables](records_reference).
