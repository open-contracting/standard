# Release Schema

The release schema provides the authoritative definition of fields and their structure. It is used to check the structure of the `releases` array of [release packages](release_package), and any `compiledRelease` fields in a [record package](record_package).

For this version of OCDS, the canonical URL of the release schema is: <https://standard.open-contracting.org/schema/1__1__5/release-schema.json>. Using the canonical URL guarantees that your software, documentation or other resources will always refer to the specific version of the schema with which they were authored and tested.

Click on schema elements to expand the tree, or use the '+' icon to expand all elements. Use { } to view the underlying schema for any section. Required fields are indicated in **bold**. [Deprecated fields](../governance/deprecation) and [multilingual fields](reference.md#language) are omitted.

This page presents the release schema in an interactive browser. You can also download the canonical version of the release schema as {download}`JSON Schema <../../build/current_lang/release-schema.json>`, download it as a [CSV spreadsheet](https://toucan.open-contracting.org/mapping-sheet/?source=https://standard.open-contracting.org/1.1/en/release-schema.json), view it as [tables](reference), or access it through the [Field-Level Mapping Template](https://www.open-contracting.org/resources/ocds-field-level-mapping-template/).
