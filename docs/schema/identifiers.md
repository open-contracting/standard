# Identifiers

Consistent identifiers are essential to help join up open contracting data.

* The Open Contracting ID (ocid) is a globally unique identifier used to join up data on all stages of a contracting process;
* Organization identifiers are important to know who is involved in each contract;
* Release, award and contract identifiers are important to help cross-reference information.

## Types of identifiers

In OCDS there are two kinds of identifiers: globally unique and local.

### Globally unique identifiers

Across the whole universe of OCDS publishers these identifiers refer to one specific contracting process or organization.

We create globally unique contracting process identifiers by adding a prefix to the internal identifiers held by publishers.

<div class="example hint" markdown=1>

<p class="first admonition-title">Worked Example</p>

Two government publishers (Town A and Town B) number their contracting processes from 0 upwards.

Town A publishes information on a contracting process to build a new road. Internally they know this as contract 0005.

Town B publishes information on a contracting process to buy textbooks for a school. Internally they also know this as contract 0005.

When they publish their OCDS data, each government adds a unique prefix onto their internal identifiers.

Now Town A's contracting process has the `ocid` of 'ocds-fh349f-0005' and Town B's contracting process has the `ocid` of 'ocds-twb234-0005'.

There is now no chance of these getting mixed up in a system which imports data from both towns.

And, if an independent civil society contract monitoring group want to publish a report about implementation of Town A's road project, or Town B's text-book procurement, they have distinct identifiers they can use in their own data to refer to these.

### Local identifiers

Not all the identifiers in OCDS need to be globally unique. Most only need to be unique among the identifiers used for the same type of object within the same scope. For example:

* A release ID must be unique within the scope of the contracting process of which it is a part;
* Award and contract identifiers must be unique within the scope of the contracting process of which they are a part;
* An item, milestone or document ID must be unique within the array it is part of.

Local identifiers must be used consistently. For example, if the `id` of an award is "22" in one release, then the `id` of the same award in another release must also be "22".

## Contracting Process Identifier (ocid)

<img src="../../_static/svg/green_compilation.svg" width="150" align="right"/>

An Open Contracting ID (ocid) is a **globally unique identifier** for a contracting process. Every OCDS release has an `ocid`.

It can be used to join up information published at different times, and in different places.

Setting the `ocid` is usually a simple two step process:

1. Identify the best **internal identifier** recorded against the contracting processes being disclosed;
2. Register an `ocid` prefix to prepend to this internal identifier.

In some cases, you might need to consider changes to existing systems to ensure that different systems handling information about your contracting processes have a common internal identifier to draw upon.

<div class="example hint" markdown=1>

<p class="first admonition-title">Worked Example</p>

In Mexico City, each time a tender or direct contract award process is initiated, the department responsible assigns an identifier.

These are made up of an identifier for the department responsible for the procurement, a tender number, and the year.

For example:

> OM-DGRMSG-004-13

This internal identifier can be exchanged with, and recorded in, any other systems which process information about this contracting process. For example, systems for reporting or recording spending transactions to suppliers.

Mexico City then registered a prefix with the OCDS helpdesk. They have been given the prefix ‘ocds-87sd3t’ which can be added to their unique process identifiers to give a globally unique `ocid`. E.g.

> ocds-87sd3t-OM-DGRMSG-004-13

</div>

The ocid prefix itself is made up of two parts: a prefix agency identifier (currently only 'ocds' is used), and a random six-character alphanumeric string generated for each publisher of data.

The ocid is case-sensitive; in other words, the letter case of an ocid must be consistent.

### Registered prefixes

Publishers must register an ocid prefix. See the [registration pages](../guidance/build) for details of how to obtain your ocid prefix.

Prefix are randomly generated lowercase alpha-numeric strings. A prefix is assigned to each organization that holds the existing internal identifier for a Contracting Processes.

Currently, only the Open Contracting Partnership issues valid prefixes. In future, other organizations might be able to issue prefixes, each with their own prefix agency identifiers.

You can find a [list of registered prefixes here along with a registration form for creating new prefixes](../guidance/build).

The registered prefixes are dumb identifiers. They are not intended to carry any semantics, and their sole purpose is to turn internal identifiers into globally unique identifiers which can be cross-referenced between systems.

### Publisher namespace

Earlier versions of this documentation imposed a stricter pattern on how internal identifiers ought to be combined with the ocid prefix, including a requirement for local namespaces. This requirement has been relaxed in practice and can be considered deprecated.

However, publishers are encouraged to consider whether there are any risks of clashes in local identifiers (e.g. the possibility that two parts of the publishing body might use the same identifier for different contracting processes) and to plan to mitigate this when establishing their own patterns to generate their `ocid`

## Organization IDs

<img src="../../_static/svg/green_organisation.svg" width="150" align="right"/>

Reliably identifying the legal entities involved in a contracting process is vital for transparency and accountability, and for carrying out analysis to improve procurement and contract management.

Publishers should seek to collect and record the **legal identifier** from an official register of any organizations involved in a contracting process (including procuring organizations, bidders and suppliers), and should include this in their OCDS files.

There are two parts to expressing an **organization identifier** in open contracting data.

1. An **organization register prefix** identifying a **register** in which the organization is identified
2. The **existing organizational ID** provided in that public register

<div class="example hint" markdown=1>

<p class="first admonition-title">Worked Example</p>

The **organization register prefix** for UK Companies House is GB-COH. The organization **Development Initiatives** has been assigned the company number ‘06368740’ by Companies House. The globally unique organization identifier for Development Initiatives can then expressed as follows:

```eval_rst
.. code-block:: json

    {
        "scheme":"GB-COH",
        "id":"06368740",
        "uri":"http://opencorporates.com/companies/gb/06368740",
        "legalName":"Development Initiatives Poverty Research Limited"
    }

```

</div>

In OCDS, the organization register prefix is included in the `scheme` field of an identifier block, with the existing organization id placed in the `id` field. If there is a recognized public URI that uniquely identifies this organization (for example, drawn from [Open Corporates](https://opencorporates.com/)) this can also be given in the `uri` field.

### Choosing an identifier

The **organization register prefix** is used to refer to a register from which the organization identifier is drawn. There are a range of different kinds of **organization list**:

* **Primary registers** - such as national or state company registrars. An identifier issued by these bodies has a specific legal meaning. There is a one to one equivalence between the identifier and a legal entity of a particular form in a given jurisdiction. The identifier is created at the same time that the organization is formally constituted, and changes to the status of the organization are recorded against this identifier in an official register. **Identifiers from a primary register are strongly preferred in OCDS.**

* **Secondary registers** - which record a particular property of an organization, such as being registered for VAT, or registered as an employer. An organizations identifier in such a registry might change without the organization itself changing in nature. For example, in some jurisdictions, an organization might de-register from VAT, and then re-register, gaining a new number in the process; or different branches of the same legal entity might register for different VAT numbers.

* **Third-party databases** - which compile a list of organizations, and sometimes their sub-units, on an on-demand basis. These databases do not confer any legal status or special properties on the organizations, but might record a mapping between their own identifiers and other primary or secondary register identifiers for the organization. A common examples of a third-party database is the proprietary Dun&Bradstreet number. The OCDS organizational identifier scheme will recognize identifiers from third-party databases, but strongly prefers those drawn from non-proprietary databases, which allow users to lookup identifier information.

* **Local lists** - Some publishers do not map their data to external identifiers, maintaining instead a local list of suppliers. In these cases, the publisher may use their internal identifiers, and should adopt their own **organization list prefix**. Where possible, the publisher should also provide their local list on the web, with as much additional data about each supplier as possible, in order to maximize the chance of data users matching their local list to some more authoritative register.

See the [full worked example](../guidance/map/organization_identifiers) for more information on implementing identifiers from these different kinds of organization lists.

If you want to disclose identifiers for natural persons, see the [personal identifiers guidance](../guidance/map/organization_personal_identifiers).

## Party IDs

Each of the parties (organizations or other participants) involved in a contracting process is declared in the [parties section](../reference/#parties).

Each party has a local identifier (`id`) used to reference it from elsewhere in the data. For example, `buyer/id` references the buyer's entry in the parties section using `parties/id`.

A party's `id` is separate from its organization identifier and need only be unique within the scope of the contracting process to which it is a party. A party’s `id` must be consistent across all releases with the same `ocid` value.

See the [guidance](../../guidance/map/organization_identifiers/#party-ids) for more information on party IDs.

## Release ID

A release identifier must be unique within the scope of the contracting process of which it is a part. In other words, across all OCDS releases with the same `ocid` value, each release identifier refers to exactly one release; no two releases use the same release identifier.

A release identifier must also be consistent within this scope. For example, if the `id` of a release is "12345" in one release package, then the `id` of the same release in another release package must also be "12345".

## Award and Contract IDs

Award and contract identifiers must be unique within the scope of the contracting process of which they are a part. In other words, across all OCDS releases with the same `ocid` value, each contract identifier refers to exactly one contract; no two contracts use the same contract identifier.

Award and contract identifiers must also be consistent within this scope. For example, if the `id` of an award is "22" in one release, then the `id` of the same award in another release must also be "22".

Contracts must cross-reference a related award (using the `awardID` field), as key information such as suppliers can be contained in the related award. Multiple contracts may refer to a single award, as in the case of a framework contract where multiple contract are issued against a single award.

## Item, Document and Milestone IDs

An item, document or milestone identifier must be unique within a given array of items, and must be used consistently across all the releases in a contracting process.

The same `id` value may be re-used in another array of items within the same release, and no cross-reference between these identifiers is implied.

The use of an identifier means that subsequent releases can update prior identified items, documents or milestones, without needing to republish all the items, documents or milestones.

For example:

* A first release sets the items to be procured in `tender/items` and the items awarded in one award in `awards/0/items`:
  * `tender/items` contains three items, with `id` values of "1", "2", and "3"
  * `awards/0/items` contains two items, with `id` values of "3" and "4"

There is *no* relationship between the item to be procured with `id` "3" and the item awarded with `id` "3"; these can be different items. Continuing the example:

* A second release updates the items awarded in the single award in `awards/0/items`:
  * `awards/0/items` contains three items, with `id` values of "3", "4", "5"

Here, there *is* a relationship between the items awarded with `id` "3" and "4" in the first release and the items awarded with `id` "3" and "4" in the second release. The second release is interpreted as updating the existing items "3" and "4" and adding a new item "5".
