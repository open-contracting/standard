# Electronic catalogs

Electronic catalogs can often be found in more complicated procedures, usually together with framework agreements and involving multiple bidders. However, on their own, they are simply an electronic format (typically prescribed by the buyer) that participants in the contracting process must follow when exchanging information about technical specifications, evaluation criteria, bids, lots, etc. As such, catalogs do not influence the structure of the data (e.g. the relationships between awards, contracts, buyers and suppliers) in any special way.
