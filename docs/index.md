Governments around the world spend an estimated [US$13 trillion](https://www.open-contracting.org/what-is-open-contracting/global-procurement-spend/) through contracts every year. Yet, contracting information is often unavailable for public scrutiny.

The Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) enables disclosure of data and documents at all stages of the contracting process by defining a common data model. It was created to support organizations to increase contracting transparency, and allow deeper analysis of contracting data by a wide range of users.

The OCDS documentation is made up of several parts, designed to help you use the OCDS effectively.

* [Primer](primer/index): Introducing the key concepts and features of the OCDS
* [Guidance](../guidance/index): Step-by-step instructions on how to design and implement an OCDS publication, including practical examples
* [Reference](../schema/index): The OCDS data model (schemas, codelists and validation rules) as well as specific rules that need to be followed to publish OCDS data
* [Getting help](../support/index): How you can get Helpdesk support, tools that can help you use the OCDS, and how you can participate in the OCDS community
* [History](../history/index): Information about the changes in each version of the OCDS
* [Data Review Tool](https://standard.open-contracting.org/review/): A tool to help check whether your data is following the OCDS correctly

The Open Contracting Data Standard is a core product of the [Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org/) (OCP). If you are interested to learn more about Open Contracting advocacy and how it can be used to support wider reform and measurable improvements in public contracting, please visit www.open-contracting.org.
