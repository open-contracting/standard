Governments around the world spend an estimated US$9.5 trillion through contracts every year. Yet, contracting information is often unavailable for public scrutiny.

The Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) enables disclosure of data and documents at all stages of the contracting process by defining a common data model. It was created to support organizations to increase contracting transparency, and allow deeper analysis of contracting data by a wide range of users.

In this documentation, you will find:

* [Getting Started](getting_started/index): Introducing the key concepts and features of the OCDS
* [Reference](schema/index): Describing the specific rules that need to be followed to publish OCDS data
* [Guidance](guidance/index): Step-by-step instructions on how to design and implement an OCDS publication, including helpful tools and examples 
* [Getting Help](support/index): Outlining how you can get Helpdesk support and how you can participate in the OCDS community
* [History](history/index): Information about the changes in each version of the OCDS 
* [Data Review Tool](https://standard.open-contracting.org/review/): A tool to help check whether your data is following the OCDS correctly.
